            <h3>About</h3>
            <p></p>

            <p>In 2007 Hamilton signed with McLaren after being a part of their young driver programme since 1998. With this signing to McLaren, he became the first and only Black driver to race in the series. His first season saw him setting multiple records by finishing as a runner-up to Kimi Raikkonen&auml;&ouml; by just one point. The very next season he won his first drivers' title and became the then-youngest ever Formula One World Champion. He signed to Mercedes after six seasons with the McLaren team. The Mercedes domination era happened at the start of 2014 with regulation changes and Hamilton won six further drivers' titles.</p>

            <p>Lewis Hamilton was born in Hertfordshire to Anthony Hamilton and Carmen Larbalestier. His parents separated when he was two where he lived with his mother and two half-siblings until he was 12 when he moved in with his father and step-mother. Being the only black child in his racing club, Hamilton was subjected to racist abuse and his experiences throughout his career has lead him to be very outspoken when it comes to the environment, combating racism, and to push for diversity in motorsport. He was knighted in the 2021 New Year Honours and was listed in the 2020 issue of Time as one of the 100 most influential people globally.</p>

            <h4>Early Career</h4>
            <h5>Karting</h5>
            <p>Hamilton started his racing career in 1993 when he joined karting championships. He quickly started winning races and two years later it would lead to him being the youngest driver to win the British cadet karting championship when he was only 10 years old. During that year, he approached the team boss of McLaren Ron Dennis and said introduced himself and that one day he would like to be racing his cars. Ron Dennis wrote in his autograph book to call him back in nine years and they would sort something out then. He then became the youngest driver to secure a contract that later resulted in a Formula 1 drive when Dennis offered him a role in the McLaren driver development programme.</p>

            <h5>Formula Renault and Formula 3 and GP2</h5>
            <p>Hamilton's car racing career started in 2001 by finishing fifth in the British Formula Renault Winter Series. The next year he moved to Formula Renault UK with Manor Motorsport and finished third. His debut in Formula 3 came in 2004 in the Formula 3 Euro Series and finishing fifth and stayed with the team for another season afterwards.</p>

            <p>The 2006 season saw Hamilton moving to ART Grand Prix and won the championship with his first attempt. The success he saw in the GP2 days coincided with a vacancy at the F1 McLaren team and there were months of speculation if he would be signed but in 2007 it was confirmed he would have the second seat with the team.</p>
