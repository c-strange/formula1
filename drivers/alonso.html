            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Fernando Alonso rates himself as a 9/10 in everything. He brings this confidence to all aspects of his racing career to preform his best. As the current oldest driver on the grid, he was a record breaker in his early career where he was at the time the youngest polesitter, race winner, world champion, and double world champion. He has won two World Championships.</p>

            <p>Signing to Renault as a test driver in 2002, he started his F1 career and was then promoted to have a race seat in 2003. His debut season saw him claiming four podiums and sixth in the drivers' championship. In 2005 he snagged the drivers' world title as the youngest ever and had won seven victories, six pole positions and 14 podium finishes. The next year he won back to back championships as the youngest ever double World Champion. The success at Renault made him very popular with other teams and Alonso signed with McLaren in 2007. The time at McLaren was not eventful for him and he moved to Ferrari in 2010 and stayed with the team until 2014.</p>

            <p>Fernando Alonso was born in Asturias, Spain to Jos&eacute; Lewis Alonso and Ana D&iacute;az with an older sister who is a doctor. His father wanted to share a hobby with his children so he built a go-kart for Alonso's older sister, Lorena. However, she was not interested in karting and the then three-year-old Alonso earned the kart. The rest was history.</p>

            <h4>Early Career</h4>
            <h5>Karting</h5>
            <p>Coming from a family that did not have the finances to fund all of the extra additions for karting, Alonso was not able to put rain tires on his kart which forced him to adapt to driving on a wet track. During his karting career from 1991 to 1998 he took four championships and finished in second twice and third once. Each of his finishes were on the podium for the championships.</p>

            <h5>Junior Racing Career</h5>
            <p>At just 17 years old, Alonso made his racing debut in the 1999 Euro Open by Nissan. He won the championship and had six wins and nine pole positions. In 2000 he rose to the higher-tier and finished fourth overall.</p>
