            <p></p>

            <p>Shortly after Lance Stroll's 18th birthday he was unvailed to the F1 grid before he finished high school or had his road driver's license. He became the second youngest driver (second to <a href="../drivers/verstappen.html">Max Verstappen</a>) to finish an F1 race on the podium and the youngest to do so in his rookie season. Signing to Williams in 2017, he became what is called a "pay driver" because it was reported that his father paid Williams $80 million to have him race. With his father investing in Racing Point, he moved to teams in 2019 finished 15th in the driver's championship for the 2019 season and 11th in the 2020 season. In 2021, Racing Point was rebranded to Aston Martin and he is still currently driving for the team.</p>

            <p>Lance Stroll was born in Quebec, Canada to Canadian businessman Lawrence Stroll and Claire-Anne Callens and has an older sister, Chloe. His parents are divorced and his father remarried to Raquel Diniz. While his father is of Russian Jewish decent, he races under the Canadian flag and holds citizenship in Canada and Belgium. He speaks English, French, Flemish, and Italian.</p>
