            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Sergio Perez has accumulated more points than any other Mexican in the history of Formula 1. He has stood on the podium 28 times and has had 5 first place finishes. Perez joined F1 with Sauber in 2011 and became the fifth Mexican to compete in Formula 1 and the first since Hector&eacute; Rebaque who competed from 1977-1981. The first race Perez took part in with F1 he finished in the points with a 7th place finish and was the only driver that race to make fewer than two stops.</p>

            <p>Perez was a member of the Ferrari Driver Academy up until 2012 when he signed with McLaren for the 2013 season. Unfortunately, the team did not score a single point the whole season and all of the successes he had in his F1 debut did not help him. His seat at McLaren was replaced. Perez signed a contract with Force India in 2014 and raced with the team until they went into administration in 2018 and turned into Racing Point in 2019. In 2020 his seat was replaced by Sebastian Vettel and was not a driver for F1 until he signed with Red Bull Racing for the 2021 season.</p>

            <p>Sergio Perez was born in Mexico and is the youngest child of Antonio Perez&eacute; Garibay and Marilu&ugrave; Mendoza de Perez. His older brother, Antonio, is a retired stock car driver who competed in the NASCAR Mexico Series. In an interview in 2012 he stated if he wasn't a F1 driver he would have liked to have been a lawyer.</p>
